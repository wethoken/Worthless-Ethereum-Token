Worthless Ethereum Token Smart-Contract

Please make sure you have visited our website and read everything that we have put there https://www.wethoken.com

Worthless Ethereum Token (WET) was created in order to raise awareness for the emerging risks associated with Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) and all the scams that have been executed under them. We aim to educate and inform users and crypto-enthusiasts on how easy it is to actually launch an ICO using the Ethereum blockchain and make anything look like a somewhat serious project.

Even tho our entire website is drawn up through satire and in an extremely sarcastic way we are pretty certain that we have managed to ultimately accomplish what we wanted to as we expose many examples that are used to deceive users. Hundreds of websites popup every now and then with a decent presentation and well-written and countless people are mislead to invest in a project with false promises and none existent companies.

Worthless Ethereum Token presents itself as one of the most honest ICOs competing with Useless Ethereum Token (UET) which was also our inspiration to startt this project. The fact that our project was inspired by UET also serves as a criticism to another event that have been happening in the crypto-space for quite a while now which is the lack of uniqueness and the constant appearance of copy-cat projects that simply change the way that their message is written and claim to present something new.

We value the progress and the growth of the crypto-space as a whole and so we truly hope that Worthless Ethereum Token can somehow bring a breath of fresh air to the ecossystem and fulfill its main goals of educating the enthusiasts at the same time that we can provide them a good moment of comedy.

Our smart-token will be made available here so that the community as a whole can contribute to it by trying to find some bugs and help us making it at least decent.
